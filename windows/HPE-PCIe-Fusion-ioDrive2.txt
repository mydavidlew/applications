1. Install the following packages necessary for compiling the Fusion-io Source Driver Packages:
   $ sudo apt install gcc fakeroot build-essential debhelper linux-headers-$(uname -r) rsync
   $ ls -al /lib/modules/$(uname -r)

2. Download the driver source file for your target operating system at
   https://link.sandisk.com/commercialsupport.html
   or
   $ git clone https://github.com/snuf/iomemory-vsl
   $ cd iomemory-vsl/
   $ make module
   $ sudo insmod root/usr/src/iomemory-vsl-3.2.16/iomemory-vsl.ko
   
3. Unpack the driver source file:
   $ tar zxvf iomemory-vsl-source_3.2.15*.tar.gz

4. Change directory to the folder created in the previous step:
   $ cd iomemory-vsl-source-3.2.15*

5. Begin the driver rebuild:
   $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b

   You can also build the driver as a root user, though this is not recommended:
   $ sudo dpkg-buildpackage

   Alternatively "debuild" can be used:
   $ debuild
   
   or
   
   Begin the Build Process:
   $ make dpkg

6. The new .deb package is located in the parent directory.

   Note: A failure of any of these builds may be due to required packages
         missing from the system. The output from the failed command
         informs you of which packages are missing. Try installing any
         missing packages and then repeating the build process.

7. Install the generated driver in conjunction with any additional files
   (fio-util, fio-firmware, etc.) that have been downloaded from
   https://link.sandisk.com/commercialsupport.html.

8. The device /dev/fioa is now available for hard drive use
