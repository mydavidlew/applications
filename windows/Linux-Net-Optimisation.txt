Network Connection Diagnosis, Tuning, Configuration and Optimisation

[[[Step #1]]]

Network diagnostics, using command below to shows the problem.

          logical name: <ens3>
          serial: 50:6b:8d:81:c4:aa
          capabilities: ethernet physical
          configuration: autonegotiation=off broadcast=yes driver=virtio_net driverversion=1.0.0 ip=10.25.187.204 link=yes multicast=yes

To displays and changes Ethernet card settings such as auto-negotiation, port speed, duplex mode, and Wake-on-LAN.
$ sudo ethtool <ens3>
Settings for ens3:
	Supported ports: [ ]
	Supported link modes:   Not reported
	Supported pause frame use: No
	Supports auto-negotiation: No
	Supported FEC modes: Not reported
	Advertised link modes:  Not reported
	Advertised pause frame use: No
	Advertised auto-negotiation: No
	Advertised FEC modes: Not reported
	Speed: Unknown!
	Duplex: Unknown! (255)
	Port: Other
	PHYAD: 0
	Transceiver: internal
	Auto-negotiation: off
	Link detected: yes

Where it shows speed=Unknown! & duplex=Unknown!, that should read 1Gbit/s with full duplex.
This indicates that most likely you've got a cabling problem. Replace ethernet cables using cat 5E or cat 6 cables, until the lshw output looks correct. The wiring is not up to the task of 1G LAN speeds.

When you're working with a problematic cable, you can disable auto-negotiation so it doesn't keep trying to renegotiate then fail.
$ sudo ethtool --change <ens3> speed <100> duplex <full> autoneg <off>
Settings for ens3:
	Supported ports: [ ]
	Supported link modes:   Not reported
	Supported pause frame use: No
	Supports auto-negotiation: No
	Supported FEC modes: Not reported
	Advertised link modes:  Not reported
	Advertised pause frame use: No
	Advertised auto-negotiation: No
	Advertised FEC modes: Not reported
	Speed: 100Mb/s
	Duplex: Full
	Port: Other
	PHYAD: 0
	Transceiver: internal
	Auto-negotiation: off
	Link detected: yes

[[[Step #2]]]

The ip can then be used to set the link up or down.
$ ip link set dev <ens3> up
$ ip link set dev <ens3> down

To verify the IP address configuration of <ens3>
$ ip address show dev <ens3>

To verify your default gateway route configuration
$ ip route show

To configure a default route gateway using ip command
$ ip route add default via <gateway-ip>

If no longer need this configuration and wish to purge all IP configuration from an interface
$ ip addr flush <ens3>
